# Drei-Dev-Project-1


Project Description:
As a library owner, I should be able to create an account, add my library and add/edit/delete  books to my library (would be best to be able to edit all the books at the same time), browse other libraries and books, be notified of any new books added to other libraries, be able to message other library owners.
